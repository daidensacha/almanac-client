              In the end of the 19th century, Wladimir Koeppen developed a
              climate classification system based on the annual and monthly
              averages of temperature and precipitation. This system is still
              used today and is the basis for the climate zones used in this
              application. The climate zones are based on the KÃ¶ppen-Geiger
              climate classification system.

              The climate zones are divided into 5 categories: A, B, C, D and E.
              A is the warmest and E is the coldest.

              The climate zones are further divided into 6 subcategories based
              on the amount of precipitation and the temperature. The
              subcategories are denoted by a letter after the main category. The
              subcategories are as follows:

              Growing vegetables at home used to be common, however it has
              become less common in recent years. This is due to the fact that
              many people live in apartments and do not have access to a garden.
              In addition, many people do not have the time to grow their own
              vegetables. This application aims to make it easier for people to
              grow their own vegetables at home. It reduces your footprint and
              helps you to eat healthier. It also helps you to save money.
