# UX Principles (mobile-first)

- One primary CTA per screen.
- “Progressive disclosure”: Year → Month → Day.
- Finger targets 44px min (MUI Button size="large" on mobile).
- Text truncation w/ tooltips for long plant names.
- Dots for density, chips for filters.
- Respect reduced motion; otherwise add gentle transitions.
