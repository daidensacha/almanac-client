## Branching Model

We follow a **clean main branch** workflow:

- **`main`** â†’ Always stable and deployable.
- **`dev`** â†’ Active development branch where new features and fixes are integrated.
- **`feature/*`** â†’ One branch per new feature or improvement. Example: `feature/calendar-view`.
- **`bugfix/*`** â†’ For targeted bug fixes. Example: `bugfix/login-redirect`.
- **`hotfix/*`** â†’ Urgent fixes applied directly to `main` (and merged back into `dev`).

### Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `dev` for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```
2. Commit your changes with clear, conventional commit messages.
3. Push your branch and open a Pull Request into `dev`.
4. Once reviewed and tested, `dev` is merged into `main` during a release.

### Commit Messages

We recommend following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

- **feat:** a new feature (e.g. `feat: add month view to calendar`)
- **fix:** a bug fix (e.g. `fix: correct date format in event card`)
- **docs:** documentation only changes
- **style:** formatting, missing semi colons, etc.
- **refactor:** code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- **test:** adding missing tests
- **chore:** build process or auxiliary tool changes

## Pull Requests

1.  Open a PR against `dev` (not `main`).
2.  Link to related issue(s) in the PR description.
3.  Ensure your code is formatted and linted.
4.  PRs require at least one review before merging.

## Issues

- Use the [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) template
  for bugs.
- Use the [Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
  template for new ideas.

## Code Style

- Client: React + Material UI, keep components clean and reusable.
